When using the connverg framework the following steps are required

1:	open the .htaccess file and change the RewriteBase command to the name of your folder
	=> RewriteBase /Folder_name/ 

2:	open the config file name config.php and set the parameters as it applies with your application
	=> Directory Constants, Database connection constants, Hash keys

	NB: you can define constants here that would or could be used later in your application

After properly configuring the framework, its time to create models, views and controllers for your application

	EXAMPLE APPLICATION: LOGIN SYSTEM

1:	Create files - controllers/index.php , models/index_model.php, views/index/index.tpl
	=> views(folder) / index(folder) / index.tpl(file)	
	=> controllers(folder) / index.php(file)
	=> models(folder) / index_model.php(file)

	NB: you can change the names of the controllers folder, models folder,
	    default file (i.e the ../index.php ) and the error file or 404 file () BUT ...
		make sure it is set in ../index.php ( ../ means root folder ) 
		i.e After this line of code
		 			* $bootstrap = new Bootstrap(); *

		 	place the following as it suits or is needed
		 			* 

		 			  $bootstrap->setControllerPath('controller_folder_name/'); 
		 			  $bootstrap->setModelPath('model_folder_name/');
    				  $bootstrap->setDefaultFile('default_file_name.php');
    				  $bootstrap->setErrorFile('error_file_name.php');

    				*

 2:	In controllers/index.php : (note: this file is a php class)
 		*
 			class Index extends Controller
 			{
 				public function __construct()
 				{
 					parent::__construct();
 				}

 				public function index()
 				{}
 			}
 		*
 		NB: The above code must necessarily be in your controllers for proper functioning
 			The index() represents your index module or index page
 			All controller classes must follow the above format, all must have an index module
 			Other methods can be added as needed by the application 
 			E.G public function logout(){}
 				public function register_user(){}

 				the example codes above represent some of the modules in the Login system / application

 3: In models/index_model.php : (note: this file is a php class)
 		*
 			a: class Index_Model extends userdao
 			{}

 			b: class Index_Model {}
 		*

 		NB: In 'a' "userdao" is a dataobject class and is used whem working with databases 
 			(check out DB_usage.txt)
 			
 			while in 'b' is used without 'userdao' when the module or page (in this case index page or login module) does not require database features or functionality.
